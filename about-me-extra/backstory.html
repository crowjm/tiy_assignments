				<h3>My Backstory</h3>
				<p>I grew up in Cantonement (pronounced Can-TONE-ment), a small town in Florida right outside of Pensacola. I'm an only child and spent my childhood with my pet chickens and cat and imaginary friends.</p>
				<p>I spent a lot of time in the summers and winters with family in Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina. There's a small town in NC named after my great-grandfather.</p>
				<p>I have another home away from home in central Mississippi. I grew up going to summer camp in a tiny town called Utica. I loved it so much, I was on staff for five years and ended up going to college in Jackson, about 30 minutes away.</p>
				<h3>So How Did I End Up In Austin?</h3>
				<p>Last March, my fella and I sold most of our stuff, packed up our cars with what we could fit in them (including our two big dogs), and made the drive to Austin. We decided to move for opportuniteis, big city adventure, and tacos.</p>
