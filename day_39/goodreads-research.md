#GoodReads Research

##My First Impressions
GoodReads' current website is very cluttered and feels a _lot_ like Amazon (who owns GoodReads). Navigating it doesn't feel intuitive. The colors feel stale and almost dirty. There's a lack of hierarchy.
The timeline page is very social, but adding friends isn't clear. There isn't an infinite scroll, but there's a lot of content. Why is the footer at the bottom?
The personal profile page and book page are very disorganized and has a lack of hierarchy.
I use GoodReads to help me read more; I like that I'm held accountable in a way by challenges and friends.

##Asking Others
I posted in the global chatroom about GoodReads and was able to ask three people questions: 1. What is your primary use of GoodReads? 2. What are your thoughts of the current design of the website? 3. If the website were redesigned, what content or features would you like to see?
####Person One
Uses GoodReads to find new audiobooks for their kids (ages 4-10) and would like to see age recommendations for books.
####Person Two
Uses GoodReads to track the books they've read, is a frequent reader. Thinks the site is cluttered and would like the genre of the book to be more apparent. Wants a better recommendation algorithm. 
####Person Three
Uses GoodReads to track the books they've read. wants the website to focus more on groups. Wants more stats and achievements. Wants to know more about the genres reads, authors read, estimated amount of pages read, etc.

##Competitors
GoodReads is ahead of the competition by a long shot, but there are other similar services. 

####Anobli
Is UK based and their website is much less cluttered.
####Shelfari
Is also owned by Amazon and feels just as dated and cluttered.
####Readernaut
Has a very clean and modern layout and is very exclusive.

##GoodReads SWOT
