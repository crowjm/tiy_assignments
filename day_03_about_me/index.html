			<h1>Getting To Know You &#9835;</h1>
			<div class="info">
				<h2>The Basics</h2>
				<p>I'm Jesse, a Web Design student in Austin, Texas. I love to cook, spend time with my dogs and fella, play board games, weave and craft, and learn new things.</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>The Backstory</h3>
				<p>I grew up in Cantonement (pronounced Can-TONE-ment), a small town in Florida right outside of Pensacola. I'm an only child and spent my childhood with my pet chickens and cat and imaginary friends.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h4>There's More</h4>
				<p>I spent a lot of time in the summers and winters with family in Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina. There's a small town in NC named after my great-grandfather.</p>
				<p>I have another home away from home in central Mississippi. I grew up going to summer camp in a tiny town called Utica. I loved it so much, I was on staff for five years and ended up going to college in Jackson, about 30 minutes away.</p>

				<h4>So How Did I End Up In Austin?</h4>
				<p>Last March, my fella and I sold most of our stuff, packed up our cars with what we could fit in them (including our two big dogs), and made the drive to Austin.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h5>But Why?</h5>
				<p>Opportunities, big city adventure, tacos.</p>

				<h3>What Makes Me Tick?</h3>
				<p>I love cooking and trying new recipes with each week's CSA box, from amazing local farm <a href="http://www.jbgorganic.com">Johnson's Backyard Garden</a> (see also for website that is well designed).</p>
				<p>I'm a dog person. I'm a weekly dog-walker at APA! and would most likely rather stay home with my dogs than go out.</p>
				<p>I'm curious and love to learn new things. Be it web design, a new weaving technique, or about the Moontower down the street from my house.</p>
				<p>Pete Seeger, Rachel Carson, and John Muir are some of my biggest heroes and I want to be a park ranger when I retire.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="info">
				<h3>Why Web Design?</h3>
				<p>I'm excited to get into a field where constant learning and experimentation/practice is essential. I want to think critically and creatively and explore design specifically. It's also related to my degree, which I am pumped to <span>finally</span> be using out in the world.</p>
