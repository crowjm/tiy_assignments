##National Park Service/Great Smoky Mountain National Park Redesign Proposal

###About the National Park Service and Great Smoky Mountain National Park
Wallace Stegner referred to the National Parks as "America's Best Idea." The idea of the Park Service began in the mid 1800s, when President Lincoln signed a law preserving Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. In 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park, and in 1916 President Wilson established the National Park Service. The National Park Service was created to protect and preserve nature for future generations, and they act as guardians of natural beauty. The [mission](http://www.nps.gov/aboutus/mission.htm) of the National Park Service is to "(preserve) unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations." You can learn more about the history of the National Park Service [here](http://www.pbs.org/nationalparks/history/).

Great Smoky Mountain National Park was chartered in 1934 and established in 1940. It's part of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the AT and is the most visited National Park in the country. It is part of North Carolina and Tennessee and in addition to preserving the land, it also helps preserve both Cherokee and Appalachian culture. It is an international biosphere reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

###Audience
* Currently, the NPS' website is geared towards teachers and kids (they each have their own links in the header and pages filled with specialized content and lessons plans). I think keeping this part of the audience is important, but I would also like to expand it to include millennials, as this is a huge demographic that is missing. Reaching a younger audience online is key as most visitors to the parks are older.

###SWOT Analysis

####Strengths 
* Very thorough content, including lots of multimedia and interactive content
* Content geared towards different interests, and a couple of different specific groups (teachers and kids)

####Weaknesses
* Because of all the content, site feels a bit cluttered
* Feels like most of the pages follow the same template format
* Because it is a government agency, feels a bit restricted and bland compared to what they actually do
* Not responsive

####Opportunities
* A better organized and responsive site
* Reach more groups of people with more targeted content (ex: create content for millenials, translate the site into other languages)
* Better display of visual and interactive elements
* Take better advantage of YouTube and podcasts
* Translate modern, exciting feel of their Twitter and Facebook pages to their website and other platforms

####Threats
* City parks that are closer and easier to get to
* Beaches and theme parks (other popular vacation destinations)
* Government shutdown
* Climate change

###Problems and Solutions

####Problems
* Feels exclusive and limited in terms of audience (teachers and kids)
* Feels a bit antiquated 
* Have to dig on website to find beauty and power of the parks
* Isn't cohesive in terms of socials vs website

####Solutions
* Make the website have a more modern (but still trustworthy, authoritative) feel. This will also help with making the site more appealing to millenials
* Streamline the vibe of their socials with the website

###Competitors 
The NPS' most direct competitor is the US Forest Service. However, they are both government branches that share the same mission, and the National Park Service is more well known. Because of their locations, visiting a National Park is a lengthy, vacation trip for a lot of people. They're threatened by other vacation destinations (like theme parks, beaches) and other local and semi-regional parks and landmarks that are more easily accessible.

Competitors of the Smoky Mountains include other parts of the Blue Ridge Mountains and AT and Chimney Rock. They're also threatened by other vacation destinations (like theme parks, beaches).
